Bheeshma Parvam is not just all about celebrating its central character Michael, but the movie narrates the deeply rooted familial discord that has passed to generations. We are introduced to a household where each character possesses a distinctive personality even if the screentime is very limited. At the same time, Bheeshma Parvam doesnt restrict itself to a dark family-action drama. The Mammootty-starrer also caters to the audience who look forward to watching some whistle-worthy moments and a great adrenaline rush.

However, Bheeshma Parvam is not a flawless film. The slow pace in the first half does look intentional, but it might not appeal to some of the audience. The second half and climax, on the other hand, look and feel rushed. However, this Mammootty-starrer is definitely a satisfying watch for the audiences who are ready to enter this crazy world without judgements.
